# Recipies

The majority of workloads that are run on cloud infrastructure can be broken down into three major categories: **batch**, **long running**, or **repeated**. We provide examples of running each of these workloads below:

#### [Batch](/mesos-cli/recipies/batch)

Run on-demand, are usually synchronous, and produce some fixed result like a transformed file.

#### Long Running (coming soon)

Long running workloads are often server processes which need to be restarted if they fail.

#### Repeated (coming soon)

Repeated workloads run at some fixed interval and are scheduled with a system like cron.
